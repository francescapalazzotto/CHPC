# CHPC_Exam
CHPC - Cloud and High-Performance Computing exam consists of parallelizing a differential equation, written in Python. 

This assignment is based on the transport equation and the implementation of a Python serial code for its (approximate) solution. It is followed by parallelization using an SPMD model and leveraging the mpi4py library for message passing within the implementation for communications.

The .pptx file presents the research and implementations conducted on a 4-core machine, along with the obtained results.
